# Maze talk thing

Hello this is the repo for a talk I have prepared.
For some reason I decided to make it an [egui](https://crates.io/crates/egui) program!
Install rust and then copy and paste this command into your terminal
`cargo r`

This talk is about searching through small mazes using bitboard tricks.
